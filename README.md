**P2P with Chord**

Implement the Chord P2P protocol as discussed in its original paper, also including the protocols to stabilize the network when new peers join or leave.
The protocol can be implemented as a Java library, together with a simple application that shows how to use the library on a practical case, or it can be simulated (measuring its main performance indicators) using OmNet++.
