# Chord P2P protocol

This JAVA Library implements the Chord P2P protocol as discussed in [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(peer-to-peer)). Includes the protocols to stabilize the network when new peers join or leave, and the network can include local clients as well as remote clients by using the public IP address.
Although the protocol is implemented as a Java library, it comes together with a simple application that shows how to use the library in a practical case.
